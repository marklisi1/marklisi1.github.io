In this project I implement a homemade version of U-Net to identify anomalous regions in aerial photos of cropland. My neural net is capable of classifying anomalies into one of nine classes and was trained/tested on the [2021 Agriculture Vision dataset.](https://www.agriculture-vision.com/agriculture-vision-2021/dataset-2021)
