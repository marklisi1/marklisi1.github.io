Work Experience
======
* EVident Battery, Data Scientist (July 2024 - present)
  * Wrangled multidimensional signal data using Python/Pandas/scikit-learn, creating models capable of price prediction and data quality assurance as the sole full-time engineer on the team
  * Fine-tuned and deployed state-of-the-art transformer models capable of diagnosing anomalies in EV battery packs with ~98% accuracy
  * Independently developed and deployed [web app](http://evidentbatterydata.com/) capable of price prediction, error detection, and estimation of useful lifespan through AWS, demonstrating proficiency with cloud computing and web hosting tools


* Yale University, Course Manager (August 2022 - May 2024)
  * Lead a team of 20 TAs & responsible for ~150 students in Yale’s Introduction to Computer Science course (CS201).
  * Wrote automated grading scripts using Yale’s Linux clusters, coordinated and hired TAs, developed novel curriculum material/exams, and acted as a reliable point of contact for students and TAs alike.
  * Sharpened leadership skills and facilitated a comfortable and efficient work environment for students and instructors.

* U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, Bioinformatics Software Engineer (August 2021 - July 2022)
  * Worked both independently and on Agile teams of ~10 developers on Cancer Care Tracking System (CCTS), a production-scale database that tracks cancer symptoms of veterans and makes predictive conclusions.
  * Routinely identified and resolved both visual front-end and logical/database back-end bugs using ASP and SQL respectively.
  * Created an interactive web page using ASP and JavaScript/D3 to visualize the timeliness of care given to patients at VAs across the country.

* Yale Center for Research Computing, Research Support Intern (June - August 2019)
  * Wrote a Slurm command [seff-array](https://github.com/ycrc/seff-array) from scratch in Python to handle job arrays and display statistics about their efficiency in a histogram, enabling all users of Yale supercomputers to request memory more intelligently and saving system time/power for all users.
  * Interfaced with Yale clusters using Python and Slurm to record hardware/partition information into a Pandas dataframe, then converted the data into an automatically updated Markdown table of cluster records.

* Yale Center for Medical Informatics, VR Engineering Intern (June - August 2018)
  * Wrote software in Unity and Blender to model molecules in VR for use in Yale medical research
  * Created a VR environment for bioengineers to analyze small-molecule interaction in proteins
  * Integrated project data with YCMI MySQL server using C#
