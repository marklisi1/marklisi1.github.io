Hello and welcome! My name is Mark and I'm passionate about harnessing the power of machine learning and data science to solve important problems in the classical sciences. 

[Take a look at some of the projects I've worked on recently!](https://marklisi1.github.io/portfolio/)

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at [EVident Battery](https://batteryevidence.com/), a New Haven-based startup developing diagnostic tools for EVs powered by machine learning. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
