Hello and welcome! My name is Mark and I'm passionate about harnessing the power of machine learning and data science to solve important problems in the classical sciences. 

[Take a look at some of the projects I've worked on recently!](/_pages/portfolio.html)

I'm currently looking for a Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or SWE position where I can use my technical skills to make a tangible difference in the world. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you feel that I could be useful on your team.
